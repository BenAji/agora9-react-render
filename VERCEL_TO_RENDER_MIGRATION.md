---

## üìù Step-by-Step Migration

### Phase 1: Backup Current Vercel Configuration

#### 1.1 Export Environment Variables

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to your project: `agora-react`
   - Go to: Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

2. **Copy All Variables**:
   Create a backup file locally (DON'T commit this to Git):

   ```bash
   # Create a temporary backup file
   # File: vercel-env-backup.txt (add to .gitignore!)
   
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://whlgmfubxeqmfdccnsqb.supabase.co
   REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
   REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
   REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY=your-weather-key-here
   ```

3. **Screenshot for Reference**:
   - Take a screenshot of Vercel environment variables
   - Keep as backup reference

#### 1.2 Note Current Configuration

Document your current Vercel setup:

```
Current Vercel URL: https://your-app.vercel.app
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: build
Install Command: npm install
Node Version: (check in Vercel dashboard)
Framework: Create React App
Custom Domain: (if any)
```

---

### Phase 2: Deploy to Render

#### 2.1 Create Render Account

1. Go to [https://render.com](https://render.com)
2. Click "Get Started for Free"
3. Choose "Continue with GitHub"
4. Authorize Render to access your GitHub account

#### 2.2 Create New Static Site

1. **Click "New +"** ‚Üí Select "Static Site"

2. **Connect Repository**:
   - Find: `BenAji/agora9-react-render`
   - Click "Connect"

3. **Configure Settings**:
   ```
   Name: agora-react
   Branch: main
   Root Directory: agora-react (if in subdirectory)
   Build Command: npm install && npm run build
   Publish Directory: build
   Auto-Deploy: Yes
   ```

#### 2.3 Add Environment Variables

**Important:** Add these BEFORE first deployment!

Copy your variables from Vercel backup:

| Variable | Value (from Vercel) |
|----------|---------------------|
| `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` | (same as Vercel) |
| `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | (same as Vercel) |
| `REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT` | `production` |
| `REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY` | (same as Vercel) |

#### 2.4 Initial Deployment

1. Click "Create Static Site"
2. **Monitor build logs** for any errors
3. Wait for deployment to complete (~2-3 minutes)
4. **Note your Render URL**: `https://agora-react.onrender.com`

---

### Phase 3: Testing on Render

#### 3.1 Update Supabase (Temporary - Add Render URL)

**Don't remove Vercel URLs yet!** Just add Render URLs alongside them.

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to: Authentication ‚Üí URL Configuration

2. **Add Render URL to existing URLs**:
   
   **Site URL:** Keep Vercel URL, just note the Render one for later
   
   **Redirect URLs (add these):**
   ```
   (keep existing Vercel URLs)
   https://agora-react.onrender.com/**
   https://agora-react.onrender.com/login
   https://agora-react.onrender.com/signup
   ```

3. **Save Changes**

#### 3.2 Comprehensive Testing

Test your Render deployment thoroughly:

**Authentication Tests:**
- [ ] Sign up with a NEW test account
- [ ] Verify email confirmation works
- [ ] Login with existing account
- [ ] Logout and login again
- [ ] Password reset flow
- [ ] Session persistence (refresh page)

**Feature Tests:**
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] Calendar page displays events
- [ ] Event details panel opens
- [ ] RSVP functionality works
- [ ] Search function works
- [ ] User profile loads
- [ ] Subscription management works
- [ ] Notifications display

**Technical Tests:**
- [ ] Open browser console (F12) - no errors
- [ ] Check Network tab - all API calls succeed
- [ ] Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes
- [ ] Check page load speed
- [ ] Verify all images load
- [ ] Check all links work

**Performance Tests:**
- [ ] Measure page load time (should be < 3 seconds)
- [ ] Check bundle size in Network tab
- [ ] Verify caching headers (refresh should be fast)
- [ ] Test cold start time (if on free tier)

#### 3.3 Comparison Testing

**Side-by-side comparison:**

1. Open Vercel deployment in one browser
2. Open Render deployment in another browser
3. Navigate through both apps simultaneously
4. Verify identical behavior
5. Compare load times

**Expected Results:**
- Both should function identically
- Render might be slightly faster
- No missing features or broken functionality

---

### Phase 4: Migration Decision Point

#### 4.1 Evaluation

After testing, answer these questions:

- [ ] Does Render deployment work as well as Vercel?
- [ ] Are all features functioning correctly?
- [ ] Is performance acceptable (or better)?
- [ ] Are there any blockers or issues?
- [ ] Have you tested on multiple devices?

**If YES to all:** Proceed to Phase 5  
**If NO to any:** Debug issues before proceeding (see Troubleshooting section)

---

### Phase 5: Cutover to Render

#### 5.1 Update Supabase (Final Configuration)

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**:
   - Authentication ‚Üí URL Configuration

2. **Update Site URL**:
   ```
   Old: https://your-app.vercel.app
   New: https://agora-react.onrender.com
   ```

3. **Update Redirect URLs**:
   - Keep both Vercel AND Render URLs for now
   - This allows rollback if needed

4. **Save Changes**

#### 5.2 Update Custom Domain (If Applicable)

**If you have a custom domain:**

**Option A: Point domain to Render**
1. In Render: Settings ‚Üí Custom Domains ‚Üí Add Domain
2. Get DNS instructions from Render
3. Update DNS records at your domain registrar
4. Wait for DNS propagation (5-30 minutes)

**Option B: Keep domain on Vercel temporarily**
- Keep Vercel as primary for 24-48 hours
- Test Render URL with real users
- Switch DNS after confirming stability

#### 5.3 Communication Plan

**Inform your users:**

**Email template:**
```
Subject: AGORA Platform Update

Hi [User],

We're excited to announce that we've migrated AGORA to a new, 
faster hosting platform!

New URL: https://agora-react.onrender.com
(or your custom domain if applicable)

- Supabase dashboard (API usage, errors)
- User feedback channels

#### 6.2 Rollback Plan (Just in Case)

**If critical issues arise:**

1. **Immediate Rollback to Vercel**:
   ```
   a. Update Supabase Site URL back to Vercel
   b. Update DNS back to Vercel (if changed)
   c. Communicate with users
   d. Debug Render issues offline
   ```

2. **Troubleshooting on Render**:

#### 7.2 Update Supabase (Final Cleanup)

1. **Remove Vercel URLs from Supabase**:
   - Authentication ‚Üí URL Configuration
   - Remove all Vercel redirect URLs
   - Keep only Render URLs

2. **Update Email Templates**:
   - Settings ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí Email Templates
   - Replace any Vercel URLs with Render URLs

#### 7.3 Update Repository

1. **Update README.md**:
   ```markdown
   ## Deployment
   
   This app is deployed on Render: https://agora-react.onrender.com
   
   ~~Previously on Vercel~~ (Migrated to Render on [date])
   ```

2. **Optional - Remove vercel.json**:
   ```bash
   git rm vercel.json
   git rm VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
   git commit -m "Remove Vercel configuration - migrated to Render"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Update package.json scripts** (if any Vercel-specific):
   - Remove any `vercel` CLI commands
   - Update deployment scripts

## üö® Troubleshooting Migration Issues

### Issue: Build Fails on Render

**Symptoms:** Build succeeds on Vercel but fails on Render

**Solutions:**
1. Check Node version compatibility
2. Verify all dependencies in `package.json`
3. Clear build cache in Render: Settings ‚Üí "Clear build cache & deploy"
4. Check build logs for specific error messages

### Issue: Environment Variables Not Loading

**Symptoms:** App works on Vercel but not on Render

**Solutions:**
1. Verify all variables are set in Render dashboard
2. Check for typos in variable names (case-sensitive)
3. Ensure variables are prefixed with `REACT_APP_`
4. Redeploy after adding variables
5. Check browser console for undefined values

### Issue: Authentication Fails

**Symptoms:** Can't login on Render deployment

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Render URL is added to Supabase redirect URLs
2. Check Supabase Site URL configuration
3. Ensure REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL is correct
4. Verify REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is correct
5. Clear browser cookies and try again
6. Check Supabase dashboard for auth errors

### Issue: Routes Return 404

**Symptoms:** Direct navigation to routes fails

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `render.yaml` has rewrite rules:
   ```yaml
   routes:
     - type: rewrite
       source: /*
       destination: /index.html
   ```
2. Ensure `render.yaml` is in repository root
3. Redeploy from Render dashboard
4. Check publish directory is `build`

### Issue: Slow Performance on Free Tier

**Symptoms:** Site is slower than Vercel

**Solutions:**
1. **Cold starts**: Free tier sites sleep after 15 min inactivity
2. **Solution**: Upgrade to $7/month paid tier (no cold starts)
3. Optimize bundle size: `npm run build` and check size
4. Enable caching (already in `render.yaml`)

### Issue: Custom Domain Not Working

**Symptoms:** DNS not resolving to Render

**Solutions:**
1. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)
2. Check DNS records are correct (use Render's provided values)
3. Verify domain ownership in Render
4. Check domain registrar settings
5. Use [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net/) to check propagation
